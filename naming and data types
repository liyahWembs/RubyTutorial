Variable names in Ruby can be created from alphanumeric characters and the underscore character. A variable cannot begin with a number. This makes it easier for the interpreter to distinguish a literal number from a variable. Variable names cannot begin with a capital letter. If an identifier begins with a capital letter, it is a constant in Ruby.
Ruby is historically not only a dynamic but also strongly typed language, now have statically typed versions.
When trying to print this x = “5” + 6, you will get an error like the one below because Ruby doesn’t allow this type of conversion
'''
C:/…/Helloworld.rb:2:in `+': no implicit conversion of Integer into String (Type Error)
	from C:/…/Helloworld.rb:2:in `<main>'
Ruby has the same built-in data type as any other programming languages.
