Before you install Rails, you should check to make sure that your system has all these installed:
•	Ruby
•	SQLite3
•	Node.js
•	Yarn

## 1.	Installing Ruby
Open up a command line prompt. On macOS open Terminal app; on Windows choose "Run" from your Start menu and type cmd.exe. Any commands prefaced with a dollar sign $ should be run in the command line. Verify that you have a current version of Ruby installed:

'''
$ ruby --version
i.e., ruby 3.0.2p107 
'''

Rails requires Ruby version 2.5.0 or later. If the version number returned is less than that number (such as 2.3.7, or 1.8.7), you'll need to install a fresh copy of Ruby.
To install Rails on Windows, you'll first need to install Ruby Installer. For more installation methods for most Operating Systems look at ruby-lang.org.

## 2. Installing SQLite3
You will also need an installation of the SQLite3 database. You can find installation instructions at the SQLite3 website.
Verify that it is correctly installed and in your load PATH:

'''
 $ sqlite3 --version
i.e., 3.28.0
'''

## 3. Installing Node.js and Yarn
Finally, you'll need Node.js, and Yarn installed to manage your application's JavaScript.
Find the installation instructions at the Node.js website and verify it's installed correctly by running this command:

'''
$ node –version
i.e., v10.16.0
'''

The version of your Node.js runtime should be printed out. Make sure it's greater than 8.16.0.
To install Yarn, follow the installation instructions at the Yarn website.
Running this command, it should print out Yarn version:

'''
$ yarn --version
i.e., 1.22.11
'''

## 4. Installing Rails
To install Rails, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems:

'''
$ gem install rails
'''

To verify that everything is installed correctly, run the following:

'''
$ rails –version
i.e., Rails 6.1.4.1
'''
